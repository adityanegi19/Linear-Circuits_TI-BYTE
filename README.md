# TI BYTE Program 2025

Welcome to the repository for the **BYTE (Build Your Technical Edge)** workshop series, hosted by **Texas Instruments** in 2025. Here you will find all weekly QUCS simulation exercises and supporting materials.

## üìò Program Overview

The BYTE Mentorship Program is a six-week immersive experience dedicated to mastering **Linear Circuit Design** and simulation techniques. Participants will benefit from:

- **Structured lectures** led by industry experts, covering fundamental analog electronics principles  
- **Hands-on QUCS simulations** to reinforce theoretical concepts  
- **Weekly assessments** to gauge progress and comprehension  
- **Interactive discussions** with Texas Instruments engineers for guidance and feedback
